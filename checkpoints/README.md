# Model Checkpoints

This directory contains model checkpoints saved during training.

## Structure

- `early_stopping/` - Checkpoints from early stopping demos
- `training/` - General training checkpoints

## File Types

- `.checkpoint` - Standard Hextral checkpoint format
- `.ckpt` - Alternative checkpoint format

## Cleanup

Checkpoints are automatically ignored by git. You can safely delete old checkpoints to save disk space.
